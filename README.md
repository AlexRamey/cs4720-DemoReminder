# cs4720-DemoReminder
Reminder demo app for class

### Project Description

You are going to build a reminder app that will run on an iPod Touch (iOS 9.2.1). You can use the iPhone 5 option in the Xcode simulator for testing.

### Things your app must have:

- [x] When the app starts up, the user should be presented with a blank list that will eventually populated with reminder items.
- [x] There should be an obvious (+) button (or something similar) to add a new reminder item.
- [x] When you tap the add button, a new screen should appear that allows you to create a new reminder item.
- [x] A reminder item should have (at a minimum): a title, a description, and a date and time that it is due.
- [x] After the item is added, the app should go back to the list screen, where the new item should appear.
- [x] In the list, you should be able to see the title and due date and time.
- [x] Items should be in order with the next upcoming item at the top of the list.
- [x] Tapping on an item brings up the information screen where you can edit it.
- [x] Swiping left on the time brings up a Delete button to remove the item.
- [ ] If the due time of an item occurs while the app is open, you should (at a minimum) show a pop up that shows the item and allows the user to dismiss the item or postpone it.
- [ ] If the user postpones the item, it should set the reminder time of that item to one hour later.
- [ ] The app must handle device rotation appropriately.

**The app DOES NOT need to show the reminder alert if the app is not open.**

**The app DOES NOT need to remember items from one run to the next.**
